**Zelis Healthcare** is my current full time project. Migrating my expertise from medical cannabis to the insurance and healthcare industry has been a learning experience; the environment is slower, more intentional, but less agile than the cannabis startup. Patience and persistence are the keys to success.

## Associate Knowledge Base 
Zelis was in need of a creative *and* technical team to migrate the knowledge base from ServiceNow to a static site. Without the budget for a team, they brought me on for my freelance experience. Using MadCap Flare and MadCap Central, I was able to take the existing content from ServiceNow, adapt it for a mobile app-like experience, and publish it for all employees to use. 

### Brand Identity
Too many products in the ecosystem creates a fractured feeling of identity, so I brought the company's brand identity to the knowledge base.

### Responsive Layout
Our senior leadership team is always on the road and some of them look to the knowledge base for tech tips. To ensure they would have the best experience while traveling, I designed the site primarily for mobile use.
