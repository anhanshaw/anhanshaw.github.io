Hey there! I'm Ariana‚Äîsometimes Ari, Ana, or *Shrimp* ü¶ê depending on who you ask.

I take technical information and break it down into easily digestible, concise, and educational content designed to coach your average user into a poweruser. Tech writing is more than just the words on the page‚Äîit's the way we empower others to own their tools with the content we create. 

In addition to being a professional technical writer, I'm a graphic designer, livestream producer, video editor, game developer, and all around hat-wearer. Learning a little about a lot helps me to connect the world together, so I take every opportunity I can to try out new technologies. 

Check out my [work](https://anhanshaw.com/projects/) and [resume](https://anhanshaw.com/cv/) in the navigation above, and when you're ready, [reach out to get in contact](mailto:arianahanshaw@gmail.com).
