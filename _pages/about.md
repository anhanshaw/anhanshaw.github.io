Hey there! I'm Ari, Ana, and sometimes *Shrimp* 🦐, depending on the situation. I take technical information and break it down into easily digestible, concise, and educational content designed to coach your average user into a poweruser. Tech writing is more than just the words on the page—it's the way we empower others to own their tools with the content we create. 

Check out my [work](https://anhanshaw.com/projects/) and [resume](https://anhanshaw.com/cv/) in the navigation above, and when you're ready, [reach out to get in contact](mailto:arianahanshaw@gmail.com).
