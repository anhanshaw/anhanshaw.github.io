Hey there! I'm known as Ari, Ana, sometimes *Shrimp* depending on the situation. I take technical information and break it down into easily digestible, concise, and educational content designed to coach your average user into a poweruser. Teaching others to take ownership and make the most of their tools motivates me to write; it's more than just the words on the page, it's the way others feel empowered by the content that inspires me. 

Check out my work and resume in the navigation above, and when you're ready, [reach out to get in contact](mailto:arianahanshaw@gmail.com).
